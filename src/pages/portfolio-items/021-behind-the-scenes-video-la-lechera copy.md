##what i did

***

This was a fun project and it happened to be my first with Casanova//McCann. While on a photoshoot, I was tasked with collecting footage to be used for an internal behind-the-scenes video. The video above was all shot and edited by yours truly.

I also helped out on the main project, which was creating photo composites with the product (La Lechera) and a given recipe. As you'll see in the video, the products and food items were photographed on grey paper, so I clipped out all the images in Photoshop as well as their shadows to make photo-realistic composites for the client.
