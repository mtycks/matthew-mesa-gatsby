##what i did

***

During my time with the Dodgers, I always tried to make an effort to bring the fans' perspective into our coverage. Sure, we had all the access and could—for the most part—get every 4K angle of a play. Sometimes, though, those videos are so professionally done that they just don't feel special.

With most fans equipped with a smartphone and an Instagram account, I searched for fans at different parts of the stadium who happened to be filming during Trayce Thompson's at bat this night. I made sure to credit the fan (because who *doesn't* like to get a shoutout from their favorite team) and also include various TV angles and Vin Scully's play-by-play for some added context.
