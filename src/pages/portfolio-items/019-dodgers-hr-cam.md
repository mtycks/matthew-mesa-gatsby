##what i did

***

I wanted to come up with more ways to merge the in-stadium experience with our online presence. With an expanding team, I was able to assign our social media coordinator, Sue Jo, the duty of tracking down fans who caught home run balls.

During my four seasons with the Dodgers, I made a point to bring the fan perspective into our social media coverageâ€”and this was a fun way to show off our fans *plus* give fans at home a glimpse of how exciting coming to a game can be.
