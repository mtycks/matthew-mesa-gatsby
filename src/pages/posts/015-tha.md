##what i did

***

Using a [hand-picked template](https://themeforest.net/item/bauer-construction-and-industrial-wordpress-theme/23904858) from the client, I built a WordPress/WooCommerce website with PayPal integration.

Although the website is using a purchased template, I added some custom functionality to the product pages to help guide the customer through the buying process as there are many options available.

I also was able to visit the client's workshop to take some product photos to use on the website. These shelves are all handmade and are pretty freaking cool.
