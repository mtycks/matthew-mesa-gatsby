##what i did

***

As part of the ongoing support I provided for MesaWater&reg;, I built and maintained several Mailchimp templates including their newsletter below. The templates were fully custom and utilized Mailchimp's content blocks for standardization, functionality to drag-to-reorder and repeatable content blocks to make things as easy as possible for the user.
