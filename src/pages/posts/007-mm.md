##what i did

***

I designed and built my portfolio website—you're on it right now!

##how i did it

***

When it's my own project I tend to do everything in the browser—including the design process. Of course, I still have to bust out Photoshop for some cutouts and Lightroom to adjust the photos but, for the most part, I'm designing the layout and tinkering with things right in the code.

This website is built using GatsbyJS, a static site generator built on top of React.
