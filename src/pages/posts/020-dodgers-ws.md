The Dodgers may not have come out on top in 2017 but our social media coverage was tops in the League.

> The Los Angeles Dodgers were the top Major League Baseball team in terms of social media this year, despite losing the World Series to the Houston Astros, according to a study by Shareablee Sports made available to Mobile Marketer. The Dodgers saw 27.9 million user actions on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter during the season, while the Astros racked up just 9.7 million social media actions, a measurement that includes reactions, comments, shares, retweets and likes across all three social channels.

According to this article, the Dodgers also had the most popular individual post of the season:

The team hadn't been to a World Series in 29 years so, needless to say, this was a big freaking dealâ€”and it showed.
